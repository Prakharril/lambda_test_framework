# Lambda Test Framework with Allure

This project is an automation testing framework built using **Python**, **Pytest**, and **Selenium WebDriver**. It is designed to run tests on the **LambdaTest** platform and generate beautiful test reports using **Allure**.

The goal was to create a clean, easy-to-use test automation setup thatâ€™s flexible and scalable.

## ðŸ§  Thought Process

I built this framework with the following ideas in mind:

- âœ… Keep test cases clean and readable using the **Page Object Model (POM)**
- âœ… Use **LambdaTest** to run tests on different browsers in the cloud
- âœ… Generate interactive test reports with **Allure**
- âœ… Use environment variables (`.env` file) to manage sensitive data
- âœ… Make the framework easy to update and extend
